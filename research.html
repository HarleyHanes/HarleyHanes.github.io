        <h1>My Research</h1>
        <p> My research primarily focuses on development of projection-based reduced-order models (ROMs) for computational physics simulations and their use in sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification. In my dissertation work I have developed methodologies for proper-orthogonal based decomposition (POD) ROMs to improve their reliability, sensitivity accuracy, and allow for sensitivity analysis of boundary conditions. I have applied this work to models of both chemical reactors and incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. In my undergraduate and master's work I also developed ecological models of disease transmission for Lyme and Chagas disease. In addition to this work I also have extensive experience in model verification and randomized linear algebra methods. </p>


        <h2> Hyper-Reduction of Non-Linear Sources in ROMs</h2>
        <!-- <p><b>Title:</b> <i>Convergence Degradation and Hyper-Reduction of Nonlinear Sources in POD-ROMs of Advection-Dominated Recirculating Chemical Reactors (In Progress)</i></p> -->
        <p><b>Summary:</b> Mathematical models of chemical reactor are critical to a wide varitiey of industries including biofuels, pharmaceuticals, and waste remediation. Models of these systems are typically advection dominated with nonlinear source terms to model chemcial reactions and often include recirculation of heat or reactants. Reduced-order models (ROMs) are a common appraoch to quickly model these reactors for control and uncertainty quantification. However, we document previously unidentified limitations in convergence of projection-based ROMs for these models. We also develop a hyper-reduction approach for nonlinear source terms that improves reliability of projection-based ROMs without increasing computational cost.</p>

        <h2> Sensitivity Equation Projection in POD-ROMs</h2>
        <!-- <p><b>Title:</b> <i>Convergence Degradation and Hyper-Reduction of Nonlinear Sources in POD-ROMs of Advection-Dominated Recirculating Chemical Reactors (In Progress)</i></p> -->
        <p><b>Summary:</b> Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-based Reduced Order Models (POD-ROMs) are a common model reduction approach for many computational physics applications. They often have improved stability compared to other projection-based ROM approaches and require significantly less data than surrogate methods such as neural networks. However, they can often have signficant errors estimating parameter sensitivities with standard finite-differences since the solution basis of the full-order model is often not a suitable basis for the model sensitivities. We use a new approach of projecting the POD basis onto the model sensitivity equations to better inform computed ROM coefficients with parameter sensitivity information. We test this approach on a chemical reactor model to determine the fidelity in FOM sampling required to accurately capture the parameter sensitivities and how the necessary fidelity compares to standard finite-differences.</p>

        <h2> Boundary Penalties for Sensitivity Analysis (In Review)</h2>
        <p><b>Title:</b> <i>Efficient Quantification of Fluid Flow Parameter Sensitivity
          Using Reduced-Order Modeling</i> [<a href="files/AIAApaperSubmission.pdf">Paper Submission</a>]</p>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Sensitivity analysis for computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations is often required for many applications but complicated by the computational cost of simulation codes. For many applications, the computational cost of quantifying the simulation's sensitivity to physical parameters (e.g., body surface roughness) and hyperparameters (e.g., subiteration convergence criterion) can be intractable for even a single simulation. Reduced-order modeling significantly reduces the computational cost of simulating fluid flows by solving on a reduced solution space informed by prior simulation data. In this work, fluid reduced-order models using boundary penalties are developed and utilized to quantify flow sensitivity to physical parameters, boundary conditions, and model hyperparameters. The proposed reduced-order modeling approach allows sensitivity analysis and uncertainty quantification of boundary conditions and enables more informed CFD frameworks.</p>

        <h2> Chagas Disease (Master's Thesis)</h2>
        <p> <b>Title: </b><i>Sylvatic and Domestic T. cruzi Transmission Cycles and Chagas Disease
           Risk in New Orleans, Louisiana </i> </p>
           <p> <b> Summary: </b> My research on Chagas Disease focuses
            on building an ordinary differential equation host-vector model of
            the transmission of <i>T. cruzi</i>, the caussative agent of Chagas
             disease, the New Orleans area. I seek to use it
             first to take the limited data sampling for the New Olreans area to
             construct an estimation of the number of infected vectors in homes,
             which is where human infections almost exculsively originate. I will
             also use the model to identify optimal steps of the transmission pathway
             for intervention so that we can develop new ways for reducing human
              risk. I have also conducted literature reviews of human case data
              to estimate the risk for human infection in Louisiana</p>

        <h2> Lyme Disease (Published)</h2>
        <p><b>Title:</b> <i>Cost Benefit Analysis of Vaccination in Tick-Mouse
        Transmission of Lyme Disease</i> [<a href="files/Lyme2019paper.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Lyme disease is one of the most prevalent and fastest
          growing vector-borne bacterial illnesses in the United States, with over
           25,000 new confirmed cases every year.  Humans contract the bacterium
           <i>Borrelia  burgdorferi</i> through  the  bite  of  the  tick <i>Ixodes
             scapularis</i>. The  tick  can receive the bacterium from a variety of
             small mammal and bird species, but the white-footed mouse <i>Peromyscus
             leucopusis </i> is the primary reservoir in the northeastern United States,
             especially near human settlement.  The tickâ€™s life cycle and behavior
             depend greatly on the season, with different stages of tick biting
             at different times.  Reducing the infection in the tick-mouse cycle
             may greatly lower human Lyme incidence in some areas.  However,
             research on the effects of various  mouse-targeted  interventions
             is  limited.   One  particularly  promising  method  involves
             administering  vaccine  pellets  to  white-footed  mice  through
             special  bait  boxes.   In  this  study, we  develop  and  analyze
             a  mathematical  model  consisting  of  a  system  of  nonlinear
             difference equations to understand the complex transmission dynamics
             and vector demographics in both tick and mice populations.
             We evaluate to what extent vaccination of white-footed mice can
             affect Lyme incidence in <i>I. scapularis</i>, and under which
             conditions this method is cost-effective in preventing Lyme disease.
             We find that, in areas with high human risk, vaccination can eliminate
             mouse-tick transmission of <i>B. burgdorferi </i>while saving money.</p>

        <!-- <h2> Power Grids</h2>
        <p><b>Title:</b><i> A Machine Learning Approach for Solving AC Optimal Power Flows</i> [<a href="files/OPF2019paper.pdf">PDF</a>]</p>
        <p><b>Summary:</b> My research group partnered with Pacific Northwest National
           Labs (PNNL) to use machine learning algorithms to solve for optimal
           generator settings on small-scale power grids. This problem, otherwise
           known as optimal power flow (OPF), is usually solved with numerical
           algorithms, but their long computation time limits operators ability
           to update generator settings in real time. We generated data sets by
           perturbing IEEE's predefined 30-bus and 300-bus power flow system and
           trained neural networks and decision tree regression algorithms (XGBoost).
           We were able to train accurate and quick algorithms for the 30-bus system but were unable to train either algorithm on 300-bus systems.</p>
