        <h1>My Research</h1>
        <p> My research primarily focuses on analysis of computational models of
        disease transmission to assist public health professionals in crafting
        interventions to reduce human risk of disease. This has been the focus
        of my two primary research projects on Chagas Disease transmission in Southern
        Louisiana and on Lyme Disease transmission in the northeast United States.
        In addition to these projects I have also worked on using machine learning
        algorithms to predict optimal generator settings in power grids and interviewing
				operators of nonprofits to assess how to build better collaborative networks.</p>
        <h2> Chagas Disease (Master's Thesis)</h2>
        <p> <b>Title: </b><i>Sylvatic and Domestic T. cruzi Transmission Cycles and Chagas Disease
           Risk in New Orleans, Louisiana </i> </p>
           <p> <b> Summary: </b> My research on Chagas Disease focuses
            on building an ordinary differential equation host-vector model of
            the transmission of <i>T. cruzi</i>, the caussative agent of Chagas
             disease, the New Orleans area. I seek to use it
             first to take the limited data sampling for the New Olreans area to
             construct an estimation of the number of infected vectors in homes,
             which is where human infections almost exculsively originate. I will
             also use the model to identify optimal steps of the transmission pathway
             for intervention so that we can develop new ways for reducing human
              risk. I have also conducted literature reviews of human case data
              to estimate the risk for human infection in Louisiana</p>

        <h2> Lyme Disease (In Review)</h2>
        <p><b>Title:</b> <i>Cost Benefit Analysis of Vaccination in Tick-Mouse
        Transmission of Lyme Disease</i></p>
        <p><b>Abstract:</b> Lyme disease is one of the most prevalent and fastest
          growing vector-borne bacterial illnesses in the United States, with over
           25,000 new confirmed cases every year.  Humans contract the bacterium
           <i>Borrelia  burgdorferi</i> through  the  bite  of  the  tick <i>Ixodes
             scapularis</i>. The  tick  can receive the bacterium from a variety of
             small mammal and bird species, but the white-footed mouse <i>Peromyscus
             leucopusis </i> is the primary reservoir in the northeastern United States,
             especially near human settlement.  The tickâ€™s life cycle and behavior
             depend greatly on the season, with different stages of tick biting
             at different times.  Reducing the infection in the tick-mouse cycle
             may greatly lower human Lyme incidence in some areas.  However,
             research on the effects of various  mouse-targeted  interventions
             is  limited.   One  particularly  promising  method  involves
             administering  vaccine  pellets  to  white-footed  mice  through
             special  bait  boxes.   In  this  study, we  develop  and  analyze
             a  mathematical  model  consisting  of  a  system  of  nonlinear
             difference equations to understand the complex transmission dynamics
             and vector demographics in both tick and mice populations.
             We evaluate to what extent vaccination of white-footed mice can
             affect Lyme incidence in <i>I. scapularis</i>, and under which
             conditions this method is cost-effective in preventing Lyme disease.
             We find that, in areas with high human risk, vaccination can eliminate
             mouse-tick transmission of <i>B. burgdorferi </i>while saving money.</p>
